# What is this? Etc, so on and so forth
This is an example of how to improve the standard WordPress tabbed plugin admin screen by using actual tabs, instead of something that looks like tabs, but actually causes a full page refresh.

This is a work in progress that needs more work.

This uses a custom endpoint of the REST API.

I will explain in detail in the Torque soon.

This uses Backbone because as much as I love Angular, Backbone ships in WordPress and works. This is way to simple to add a bunch of extra scripts.

This is NOT ACCESSIBLE, this has UNTRANSLATABLE STRINGS, that is BAD. This is just a demo, you must not use "oh it's JavaScript" as an excuse to fuck that up.

The JavaScript is kind of hacky. This is partially a result of me going into this with like 1 Backbone XP and partially because I think that when writing education code it helps to make things a little less DRY and more explicit.
